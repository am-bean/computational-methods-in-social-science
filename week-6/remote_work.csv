"Holy smokes. In all seriousness I’m bummed that you wrote such an aggressive post because I I somewhat agree with the spirit of your rant. It’s a bit different now, but during the pandemic I felt like the whole world thought the solution was “just work from home” which really left out so much of society. I work in marketing in the tech sector and we used to live in a major city where everyone I knew had office jobs that were easily transferable to home. Right before the pandemic we moved to my hometown which is very blue collar. I saw how people were struggling and WFH wasn’t an option: bank tellers, hair dressers, grocery store workers, distributors, etc. It felt to me like they were so left behind and not considered. Meanwhile all of our friends in Chicago very much had the attitude of “What’s the big deal, just work from home and home school your kids?” My sister lives in the DC area and her and her husband switched to remote work, which saved them an annoying commute and was of course more convenient. She couldn’t understand why people in our town were upset about the lockdowns: they couldn’t work from home and instead were just losing money or dealing with hellish childcare situations. Even though I always WFH, I was honestly offended on behalf of other people at the time. It left a bad taste in my mouth. So, your ugly attitude aside, I don’t totally disagree with you - I just don’t have a solution. I certainly don’t think that just making it suck for everyone because it sucks for some is an answer though. I just try to be as self-aware as possible and realize not everyone has the same options as me, and try to be kind.",2023-02-01 02:41:11,j6q6i33,t1_j6nf1f2,3,10plq1f,False

"This was 15 years ago, but I worked in an insurance-adjacent company staffed primarily by women in the US south. Even though my position was not customer-facing, I got more favorable treatment if I was more polished and more put together - hair styled, makeup on, appropriate business casual clothes. It was subtle pressure, but the times I didn’t wear makeup (but wore the same appropriate clothes) I was told I “looked like my heart wasn’t in it” or that I “wasn’t taking my job seriously” and that “this isn’t college.” Would I have been fired? Not sure. It was At Will employment so they could have fired me for not liking the color of my shirt if they wanted. I was young and needed the job, so I judged that was in my best interest to play along with what I saw and was told were the expected appearance norms of the office. Did I resent it? Fuck yes. A lot. However, expectations like this are rarely spelled out in a way that can be pointed at as a definite “do this or get fired.” I was worried that not being polished enough could cost me promotions or pay increases, which was something I needed to support myself. 

As for any follow up questions, could I have sued if I felt that not wearing makeup got me fired or interfered with my upward progress in the company? Probably not. It would have been almost impossible to draw a direct line between “you don’t look like your heart is in it today” and not getting promoted.

Then everything transitioned to Zoom, Meet, and Teams and suddenly I regained nearly 10 hours a week of time that I could now use to do actual work instead of just talking about work. It was great, it was like getting a full extra day of work in.

But I was so worried everything would go back to normal once the pandemic ended and we'd be back to face-to-face meetings. And some of my customers certainly tried. But I pushed back and now only meet in person if the customer absolutely insists on it.

"> Most salary jobs don’t get paid overtime friend

Look I am not from the US, but not paying overtime is literally illegal here. They even HAVE TO pay you a higher rate than is your regular rate for overtimes. Maybe that is not the case in the US, but I very much doubt it. Are you trying to tell me it is okay for an accountant to be told they will be working 9-5 for let's say 90k a year, but then you expect them to work 7am-10pm + weekends for free? No way that's not illegal even in the US...

It is fine to like your job. If you don't mind being exploited then that's on you. I am not telling you how to live your life, so if you like it that way then continue to do so. Just sounded like you were complaining about it.

But if you are not doing a ""dead end job"", then might as well find a different firm that actually pays you for the work you do.

Close to six figure salary is not that much of a brag if you work 80 hour weeks.

>	For the US, workers spend their time savings similarly to the overall average — where 42% of it is for primary or secondary jobs, 35% for leisure, and 8% for caregiving duties.

Employees are not ""mainly"" working more at all. On average, people use most of this time saved for other, non-work activities. And of that 42% spent working, they bundle primary and secondary jobs! So if you decide to pick up a side hustle, that gets counted in these stats.

Sure, people are putting in extra time when working from home. I certainly do sometimes. But part of that is because I don't need to worry about leaving the office before traffic gets bad. I can continue working until I hit a natural break, then log off for the day.

I love being able to sign off of work & immediately starting my own personal life up as easy as 1-2-3. Some people might struggle with the balance but that only happens when I'm on-call which is only every 3-4 weeks for a week; only then is my work-life-balance all kinds of wrong.

"If companies are getting more work out of their wage slaves, why frame it as a bad thing? Oh, Business Insider is pushing the “WFH bad” narrative.

Here are some pros for WFH:

- Health and Safety: No commute means no risk of a potentially fatal accident on dangerous roads. There’s also the mental benefits of being in your safe space at home, interacting with pets, doing something meaningful during a break. There’s also less chance of catching and spreading sickness 

- Cost benefits: Less money spent on commuting costs, vehicle maintenance, or even owning a vehicle in some cases. Also the option to eat lunch at home instead of dining out daily

- Quality of Work: WFH is really “work from anywhere” for many. That means people can work somewhere that helps them focus and stay focused. That could be a home office, the dining table, a cafe, or even the local library 

There are cons like losing face-to-face social interactions. But remember that not all of those were pleasant. You’re also less likely to be micromanaged at home. Which is what managers really want from all of this. Managers don’t trust their workforce to work hard without constant supervision. And if workers do their job without supervision, the role of “manager” becomes obsolete",2023-01-31 15:26:26,j6na8ug,t3_10plq1f,2,10plq1f,False

"Over the past year I've felt like the propaganda against remote work has been growing. I've seen the messaging go through several waves. 

At first we were supposed to feel sorry for mismanaged cities with bloated budgets who haven't done enough to attract people and are incapable of adapting. Then we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards employers because of the supposed loss of collaboration and how some workers might be taking advantage.

Now we're seeing a new phase where we're being told remote work isn't as good as we think it is. The fact that Americans work more than the rest of the world is irrelevant to this particular discussion. It's difficult to make a direct comparison anyway, considering the differences in commutes and workplaces. 

I can think of several factors influencing the stats in the article... First, as good as public transit is in Japan, average commutes are longer than in the US; 31 minutes vs 27.6. The average for Tokyo is 58 minutes vs 26 minutes for NYC. When I worked in Taiwan my commute was an hour and a half and that was with a fantastically reliable subway system that handily beats what New York has to offer.

Secondly, there are certain qualities that are somewhat unique to Asian companies. They love busywork and as a result do a lot of things manually that have long since been automated in the US. Furthermore, they're still averse to leaving work before their boss does, even if they've got nothing left to do. So of course being remote will have an outsized impact. 

Then there are other factors to consider; a big one being that wages in Asia have remained stagnant for decades. I don't see the average American tech worker being satisfied by the salaries their counterparts in Asia are pulling. Not that I think the American model is preferable at all, but my underlying point is that remote work is a net positive for everyone who can partake in it.",2023-01-31 15:55:17,j6ner5i,t3_10plq1f,2,10plq1f,False

"2019:
Get up at 5:30, leave house by 6, drop kid at before care ($65/mo) by 6:30, drive to work, arrive at 7:30. Look busy, click things, refresh inbox for at least 2 hours of a 9 hour day, sit in meetings where we plan more meetings for the rest of the day. Leave by 4:30, pick up kid from after care by 6, home by 6:30. Get dinner together and eat. Kid in the bath, read a book, in bed by 8. Clean up from dinner and sit down and relax (or do school work) and be in bed by 10. 
Commute was usually ~three hours round trip. Dog got walks on the weekend. Most house chores were left for the weekend on top of family time, grocery shopping, etc.

2020: moved houses, went remote during pandemic.

Today:
Roll out of bed at 7:30, turn on laptop while making kid’s lunch. Run them to school at 8, five minutes from home. Make some tea, sort my emails, work my inbox, complete some work before first virtual meeting at 10. Between 10 and 11:00 meeting, throw some laundry in the washer. Lunch at noon, take the dog for a walk, switch laundry, do dishes. Make a healthy lunch and eat during 1:00 meeting. Get on stationary bike during afternoon, swap laundry, respond to any new emails. Step out at 3 to pick up kid from school, back at desk by 3:15, finish any outstanding work for the day and shut off computer at 4:30.
Check in on kid’s homework, find out about their day. Sit and relax for an hour, start cooking a meal. Eat dinner, clean up, play a game with the kid, do some homework, kid in bath and bed by 9. In bed by 10.
I do go into the office 2 days a week, commute is now 1 hour round trip and I go in at 9, leave at 2 to do school drop off/pick up. I work the rest from home where 90% of my work is complete by 10 am and the rest of my day is meetings and reacting to meetings. All of my house chores are now done during the week and my weekend is leisure.

"Well duh...

The point about WFH is that it lets me manage and deal with my time much more efficiently. I do have an incentive to be a valuable employee, and will try to use my time most efficiently to do this.

It's not just saving commute time, it's so many little details that add up. This lets me use the time better, not just from commute (I generally had little commute, and because I biked I considered it cardio time, and lost that, so it wasn't that much of a gain for me). I am able to better mesh my life and work, and keep their balance better. I don't have to leave early or start late, instead I can choose a small 15 min window between meetings (which is dead time for all purposes) to take my clothes to the dry cleaner, something that I would have had to leave early before. Similarly if there's a deadtime at my home in the early morning, I could use it to get some work in early, to save myself time in the evening. Before, having to go to the office, such an exchange would not be viable: it'd be getting up early, and getting ready, and going to the office, and then still getting the stink eye when I leave early. With WFH the only people aware of when I go in or out are the people who care about my work and can see it's results, rather than the illusion of process.

And yeah, all this inefficiency, I dumped it on work. I mean it's one third a day for sleep, one third a day for work, and one third a day to sustain myself (which is beneficial to work) and then use whatever is left for myself. If there's time missing, it was always work, it always will be work, it already takes too much of my time and wastes it. And the employees that don't do this very quickly jump out after severe burnout. So when I'm able to improve on it, work is the one that will recover most time.

And it makes sense. Everywhere during 2020 they saw a productivity boost due to WFH. In spite of all the serious stress that people were in, in spite of all the serious problems and constant turmoil.

"Every industry is different. But this tracks with my experience.

I’m a software developer lead, what we see is developers putting in more time voluntarily. There’s a lot of reasons for this. Some are trying to show they’re eager and ready for a “senior” promotion, others are just passionate about the work we’re doing. Juniors learning are eager to do more and more to get that valuable experience (in our industry, experience is Gold.) 

To some degree, the time saved really is time earned for the business. I try to encourage and also nudge developers to work within their hours. I tell them “the work isn’t going anywhere and there are always new problems to solve.”

That said, ambitious people will always put in more time. 

There’s also the interpersonal side of things. Sometimes a business analyst will need something from a dev and the developers do them favor and stay up late. Purely because they like working together. Also, if we see a manager is in a bind, we’ll step up and crunch and we always get that back in some way later on.

It’s really complicated for sure. I can see people absolutely working more with work from home. Passionate people don’t have constraints.

"A large proportion of my work meant being at a remote site, 1 – 2 hrs away from home, at 08.00 - 09.00, if I could get in to the building at that time, then doing prep work from overnight tasks ready to go to formal presentations at 10.00. 

  
WFH meant not only saving on the commute but being able to log on as early as I like to do the prep work, being able to do it more thoroughly and do more detailed research so the product for 10.00 was better with issues resolved and delays avoided. 

  
At the other end of the day, instead of timing my journey home to avoid rush hour, deal with the seemingly endless roadworks etc, I had extra time to ‘mop-up’ and do work ‘housekeeping’ tasks. The use of ‘ MS Teams’ allowed immediate contact with colleagues and managers who might also be at home or working out of the main office. On average I was actively working an additional 8-10 hours per week. 

  
I benefited from not being disturbed by a noisy ‘open plan’ office, actually being able to have a lunch break, using my ‘home study’ which was more comfortable and better equipped than the cramped office ‘hot desk’ facilities, not fighting for limited parking spaces and less stress in my day.
