"Wild shot in the dark here, but I think the bicameral mind theory is pretty interesting and might explain why humanity has taken a wild turn in terms of our societies compared to the rest of our relatively standard primate evolutionary history. I also think farming and cooking our food has a lot to do with the extinction of mammoths.

Mammoths were grazers after all, and it wouldn't surprise me if they started to interfere with early human settlements and agriculture in a way we didn't approve of, so we eradicated them. Modern Asian elephants also cause significant amounts of damage to human settlements in places like India and Sri Lanka even today, so ancient humans might have treated them as a similar nuisance.",2023-02-01 04:05:28,j6qhb54,t1_j6oqk2u,1,10py29t,False
We‚Äôre living in an interglacial period *with* unprecedented human caused global warming.,2023-02-01 00:39:13,j6ppqdu,t1_j6poc9n,4,10py29t,False
"Glacial periods vs. interglacial periods are primarily related to the [exact position](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/) of earth relative to the sun, which vary over very long but to a large extent predictable intervals. To some extent, a couple of [other processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447376/) also play a role. Here's a [brief overview](https://www.livescience.com/what-causes-ice-ages.html). All these changes are slow -thousands of years- but once reaching a tipping point things can move relatively fast due to feedback processes.

Global warming is caused by rapid rise in greenhouse gases that is unprecedented in amount and speed, literally only a couple of hundreds years. A rapid increase caused by industrialisation where loads of greenhouse gases are released because we burn stuff, mostly fossil fuels.

Regardless of the initial trigger (the natural process for interglacial periods or the human-induced for global warming), once you reach a certain point it speeds up and is difficult to stop because of feedback processes. For example, reduced ice cover = more sunlight absorbed (ice reflects it) = warmer = further reduction in ice cover, and so on. Similarly, warmer temperatures = reduction of permafrost = naturally captured greenhouse gases can now leak from the earth = causing warmer temperatures, and so on. Right now there's a push to reduce our emission of greenhouse gases, hoping that we'll avoid getting to the tipping point where the feedback processes take over.",2023-02-01 02:49:11,j6q7le4,t1_j6poc9n,1,10py29t,False
What is the difference of the human global warming and that interglacial period?,2023-02-01 00:29:31,j6poc9n,t1_j6oqk2u,1,10py29t,False
"True, there are two main theories, but they only really work when combined.

We know that humans were succesful hunters of mammoths, but we also know that humans lived for a long time with mammoths before they disappeared.

We know that mammoth populations were reduced due to the changes in habitat caused by the change from ice age to interglacial period (we're currently living in an interglacial period). However, they managed to survive several such changes without disappearing - there's a reason it's called the ""last ice age"". There had been others before it, each separated by a warmer interglacial period.

However, mammoths only experienced one reduction in habitat caused by the change from ice age to interglacial period while *simultaneously* subjected to human hunters. And at that point they became extinct.

Within the scientific community, there's a fairly strong split between a group arguing climate as a cause of this prehistoric extinction and a group arguing hunting as a cause of this prehistoric extinction (not just for mammoths, but a number of other prehistoric extinctions, too). The first group generally fail to explain why mammoths survived through several ice age-interglacial events, only disappearing the last time. The second group generally fail to explain why humans lived with and hunted mammoths for a pretty long time before suddenly managing to cause their extinction.

This has some relevance today too. There are lots of animals today that have been seriously affected by hunting and direct habitat loss (e.g., deforestation, draining of wetlands), but still manage to survive in reduced numbers. However, when combined with the -also caused by humans- global warming, they may end up disappearing entirely.

"It‚Äôs my understanding that the issues that plagued dolly and the conclusions drawn from the ‚Äúage of the dna‚Äù aren‚Äôt as clear cut as once believed. 

I‚Äôm very much not an expert so don‚Äôt just take my word for it but I remember learning that although DNA does become damaged or changed as an organism grows it‚Äôs not necessarily entirely to blame for the issues a clone may suffer. In the case of dolly and other early cases, lots of issues stemmed from how new the technology was. 

As time went on, experimentation in the field grew and we learned more about the mechanism behind cloning. We were able to refine the process, leading to better methods and healthier clones.

There‚Äôs also the fact that in this particular case the proposed woolly mammoths are not really clones. DNA from mammoths has been extracted and sequenced but (and I might be wrong here) I think it‚Äôs not possible or at the very least very unlikely to straight up clone mammoths. DNA is a tricky thing and even the best preserved mammoth samples decayed as to be virtually unusable for cloning long before we found them.

The efforts to bring back woolly mammoths, aurochs and other extinct species with closely related species still living focuses instead on engineering an animal to express traits similar to that of the extinct species. Figure out which genes make elephants hairless, shut them off and boom, you have a woolly elephant, not quite a mammoth but its closer. Using the extinct species‚Äô DNA as a guide you can sort of get an animal that‚Äôll resemble it while still being mostly the living species under the hood. 

How much we can recreate or if the resulting modified elephant can even be called a Mammoth are still up for debate.",2023-02-01 01:18:10,j6pv4g9,t1_j6olw7b,3,10py29t,False
"Funny because I remember hearing them talk about having to take an elephant cell suck out all the dna of the elephant and switch it with mammoth dna. Then put it back in the elephant to have it birth the mammoth. Only problem is it still has the dna of the mammoth. So whatever age it was when it died or froze. Then that‚Äôs basically the age of the clone. Not it terms of days but the dna will be on the last stages of its life so like what happened with dolly.
Prob will develop a shit ton of older illnesses or whatever. Still super cool and hopefully have found more than one mammoth so we can breed them. Not sure if they have ever had two cloned animals breed before but curious to know if the newborn has brand new set of dna or still some corrupted.",2023-01-31 20:20:27,j6olw7b,t1_j6nfqka,1,10py29t,False

Now imagine doing that when they have much less viable DNA, with the pregnant females being much too small anyway. And bringing a literal Ice Age animal into a world where all the ice is melting.

Why would you think the Mammoths would be released out to Africa & Southeast Asia of all places? They're meant for the Arctic. In the cold North.

And in the North, there are trees, too many of them. Because of global warming the forests in the North are growing further north, which is a problem. The artic is supposed to reflect heat. Which it would be if its mostly grasslands and snow. But forests shade the grass from the sun and kills them, meaning more open dark soil, meaning more heat absorbed, meaning more melting. Which then makes it suitable for trees to grow, which then perpetuates the problem.

The role of Mammoths used to be to help regulate this growth of the forest as they trample through it, and thus ensuring grasslands to exist and cover the dark soil. Certainly, humans could perform that function of cutting down trees.

2. It's easy to get fertilized mouse eggs, and also to implant them in a surrogate to see how they come out.  That's going to be far more challenging with an elephant population, both from a logistics and an ethics perspective.  (Imagine the backlash if it comes out that they're euthanizing elephants if the fetus doesn't develop properly.)
3. A lot of their changes are to match an extinct species, which means we don't know exactly how that genetic modification plays out in the creature's anatomy/physiology.  We can say that ""this gene seems likely connected with body hair,"" but we don't know for sure, which will make it harder to measure if a modification was successful.

"IMO quite likely to partially succeed (1 & 2 below, perhaps even 3), but quite unlikely to fully succeed. Regardless, they'll certainly need much more than 4 years. An elephant pregnancy alone lasts almost 2 years.

1. We already have DNA from mammoths, but DNA degrades with time meaning that old DNA is incomplete with a bunch of ""holes"" in it. Basically sections on the DNA chain where we don't have any data. They're planning on filling the ""holes"" with elephant DNA, resulting in a part-mammoth part-elephant animal. The science for doing that already exists.

2. A donor egg (the obvious choice being an elephant) has to be emptied for DNA, which instead is replaced with the new part-mammoth part-elephant DNA. The science for doing that already exists. This egg cell has to be implanted into a mother, again the obvious choice would be an elephant. The science for doing that already exists. However...

3. The failure rate tends to be pretty high. If they've followed all the steps in 1 & 2 and there are no problems with the DNA, they'll probably still need a handful of mothers where eggs have been implanted to even get a single successful birth. Who has a handful of female elephants at the peak of their reproductive life that they're willing to use for this? Zoos are already working hard to maintain their current elephant populations. Removing a handful of females at the peak of their reproductive life to function as potential mothers for part-mammoth part-elephant babies would definitely cause a serious hit to the efforts of preserving existing zoo elephant populations. Zoo elephant populations are also managed via continent-wide organizations (AZA for North American zoos) and if a zoo decides to just disregard it they risk getting booted, which can be very damaging (preventing the zoo from swapping animals, not just elephants, with other zoos). Furthermore, we're not even close to knowing what all sections in an elephant's DNA encodes for. We know even less about the mammoth's. There are lots of extremely complicated processes where a tiny error is fatal. So, they might manage to combine the mammoth DNA and the elephant DNA and put it into an egg, but then every single young is aborted prematurely because of some problematic DNA combination. It could be near-impossible to find the exact DNA combination that caused the problem.

4. Let's say they've somehow solved all the things in steps 1-3 and got a part-mammoth part-elephant young. Now what? Who's going to teach it how to be a mammoth? Elephant young depend heavily on their family to learn the basics of being an elephant. Mammoth diet and lifestyle was quite different.

5. Let's say they've somehow solved all the things in steps 1-4 and have a single healthy part-mammoth part-elephant that also behaves pretty much like a mammoth. But a single mammoth isn't going to work. To survive long-term and avoid serious inbreeding problems, they'll need a bunch of different individuals of both sexes.

B/c elephants are so social and intelligent, and most people who study them claim they have something akin to language and that they do have culture, the scientist was worried that raising a mammoth in isolation from others of his species would be a form of torture. The argument was interesting. Are mammoth's socially and psychologically similar to elephants? Can we use elephants to draw lessons from? Would a mammoth be adopted into an elephant troop and take part of their culture or be rejected? If it was rejected what would be the psychological impact? If a group of mammoths were born together would that be okay, or would there be other problems b/c they wouldn't be born into a troop to teach them basic cultural practices? 

I wish I could remember what I read it in, I just remember it was a book about de-extinction and had a yellow cover. But the argument was convincing enough to me that based on what we know about elephants, assuming mammoths are fairly similar the way chimpanzees are similar to gorillas in their social aspects, that cloning a lone mammoth could be exceedingly cruel. There should be a lot of work done to minimize the chances of creating an animal that's existence would basically amount to social and psychological torture to see if a cloning experiment works.",2023-01-31 18:50:16,j6o7bjm,t3_10py29t,1,10py29t,False
