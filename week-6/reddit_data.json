Modern Asian elephants also cause significant amounts of damage to human settlements in places like India and Sri Lanka even today, so ancient humans might have treated them as a similar nuisance.", "created_at": 1675224328.0, "id": "j6qhb54", "parent": "t1_j6oqk2u", "score": 1}, {"body": "We\u2019re living in an interglacial period *with* unprecedented human caused global warming.", "created_at": 1675211953.0, "id": "j6ppqdu", "parent": "t1_j6poc9n", "score": 4}, {"body": "Glacial periods vs. interglacial periods are primarily related to the [exact position](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/) of earth relative to the sun, which vary over very long but to a large extent predictable intervals. To some extent, a couple of [other processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447376/) also play a role. Here's a [brief overview](https://www.livescience.com/what-causes-ice-ages.html). All these changes are slow -thousands of years- but once reaching a tipping point things can move relatively fast due to feedback processes.\n\nGlobal warming is caused by rapid rise in greenhouse gases that is unprecedented in amount and speed, literally only a couple of hundreds years. A rapid increase caused by industrialisation where loads of greenhouse gases are released because we burn stuff, mostly fossil fuels.\n\nRegardless of the initial trigger (the natural process for interglacial periods or the human-induced for global warming), once you reach a certain point it speeds up and is difficult to stop because of feedback processes. For example, reduced ice cover = more sunlight absorbed (ice reflects it) = warmer = further reduction in ice cover, and so on. Similarly, warmer temperatures = reduction of permafrost = naturally captured greenhouse gases can now leak from the earth = causing warmer temperatures, and so on. Right now there's a push to reduce our emission of greenhouse gases, hoping that we'll avoid getting to the tipping point where the feedback processes take over.", "created_at": 1675219751.0, "id": "j6q7le4", "parent": "t1_j6poc9n", "score": 1}, {"body": "What is the difference of the human global warming and that interglacial period?", "created_at": 1675211371.0, "id": "j6poc9n", "parent": "t1_j6oqk2u", "score": 1}, {"body": "True, there are two main theories, but they only really work when combined.\n\nWe know that humans were succesful hunters of mammoths, but we also know that humans lived for a long time with mammoths before they disappeared.\n\nWe know that mammoth populations were reduced due to the changes in habitat caused by the change from ice age to interglacial period (we're currently living in an interglacial period). However, they managed to survive several such changes without disappearing - there's a reason it's called the \"last ice age\". There had been others before it, each separated by a warmer interglacial period.\n\nHowever, mammoths only experienced one reduction in habitat caused by the change from ice age to interglacial period while *simultaneously* subjected to human hunters. And at that point they became extinct.\n\nWithin the scientific community, there's a fairly strong split between a group arguing climate as a cause of this prehistoric extinction and a group arguing hunting as a cause of this prehistoric extinction (not just for mammoths, but a number of other prehistoric extinctions, too). The first group generally fail to explain why mammoths survived through several ice age-interglacial events, only disappearing the last time. The second group generally fail to explain why humans lived with and hunted mammoths for a pretty long time before suddenly managing to cause their extinction.\n\nThis has some relevance today too. There are lots of animals today that have been seriously affected by hunting and direct habitat loss (e.g., deforestation, draining of wetlands), but still manage to survive in reduced numbers. However, when combined with the -also caused by humans- global warming, they may end up disappearing entirely.\n\n(edit: spelling)", "created_at": 1675198157.0, "id": "j6oqk2u", "parent": "t1_j6oabag", "score": 53}, {"body": "The powerful thing here is the ability to coordinate 30 people to all be throwing those spears in a unified attack.", "created_at": 1675248968.0, "id": "j6rfsd1", "parent": "t1_j6qjba7", "score": 2}, {"body": "Yes, and throwing things.

Regardless, they'll certainly need much more than 4 years. An elephant pregnancy alone lasts almost 2 years.\n\n1. We already have DNA from mammoths, but DNA degrades with time meaning that old DNA is incomplete with a bunch of \"holes\" in it. Basically sections on the DNA chain where we don't have any data. They're planning on filling the \"holes\" with elephant DNA, resulting in a part-mammoth part-elephant animal. The science for doing that already exists.\n\n2. A donor egg (the obvious choice being an elephant) has to be emptied for DNA, which instead is replaced with the new part-mammoth part-elephant DNA. The science for doing that already exists. This egg cell has to be implanted into a mother, again the obvious choice would be an elephant. The science for doing that already exists. However...\n\n3. The failure rate tends to be pretty high. If they've followed all the steps in 1 & 2 and there are no problems with the DNA, they'll probably still need a handful of mothers where eggs have been implanted to even get a single successful birth. Who has a handful of female elephants at the peak of their reproductive life that they're willing to use for this? Zoos are already working hard to maintain their current elephant populations. Removing a handful of females at the peak of their reproductive life to function as potential mothers for part-mammoth part-elephant babies would definitely cause a serious hit to the efforts of preserving existing zoo elephant populations. Zoo elephant populations are also managed via continent-wide organizations (AZA for North American zoos) and if a zoo decides to just disregard it they risk getting booted, which can be very damaging (preventing the zoo from swapping animals, not just elephants, with other zoos). Furthermore, we're not even close to knowing what all sections in an elephant's DNA encodes for. We know even less about the mammoth's. There are lots of extremely complicated processes where a tiny error is fatal. So, they might manage to combine the mammoth DNA and the elephant DNA and put it into an egg, but then every single young is aborted prematurely because of some problematic DNA combination. It could be near-impossible to find the exact DNA combination that caused the problem.\n\n4. Let's say they've somehow solved all the things in steps 1-3 and got a part-mammoth part-elephant young. Now what? Who's going to teach it how to be a mammoth? Elephant young depend heavily on their family to learn the basics of being an elephant. Mammoth diet and lifestyle was quite different.\n\n5. Let's say they've somehow solved all the things in steps 1-4 and have a single healthy part-mammoth part-elephant that also behaves pretty much like a mammoth. But a single mammoth isn't going to work. To survive long-term and avoid serious inbreeding problems, they'll need a bunch of different individuals of both sexes.

Oh, Business Insider is pushing the \u201cWFH bad\u201d narrative.\n\nHere are some pros for WFH:\n\n- Health and Safety: No commute means no risk of a potentially fatal accident on dangerous roads. There\u2019s also the mental benefits of being in your safe space at home, interacting with pets, doing something meaningful during a break. There\u2019s also less chance of catching and spreading sickness \n\n- Cost benefits: Less money spent on commuting costs, vehicle maintenance, or even owning a vehicle in some cases. Also the option to eat lunch at home instead of dining out daily\n\n- Quality of Work: WFH is really \u201cwork from anywhere\u201d for many. That means people can work somewhere that helps them focus and stay focused. That could be a home office, the dining table, a cafe, or even the local library \n\nThere are cons like losing face-to-face social interactions. But remember that not all of those were pleasant. You\u2019re also less likely to be micromanaged at home. Which is what managers really want from all of this. Managers don\u2019t trust their workforce to work hard without constant supervision.

I've seen the messaging go through several waves. \n\nAt first we were supposed to feel sorry for mismanaged cities with bloated budgets who haven't done enough to attract people and are incapable of adapting. Then we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards employers because of the supposed loss of collaboration and how some workers might be taking advantage.\n\nNow we're seeing a new phase where we're being told remote work isn't as good as we think it is. The fact that Americans work more than the rest of the world is irrelevant to this particular discussion. It's difficult to make a direct comparison anyway, considering the differences in commutes and workplaces. \n\nI can think of several factors influencing the stats in the article... First, as good as public transit is in Japan, average commutes are longer than in the US; 31 minutes vs 27.6. The average for Tokyo is 58 minutes vs 26 minutes for NYC. When I worked in Taiwan my commute was an hour and a half and that was with a fantastically reliable subway system that handily beats what New York has to offer.\n\nSecondly, there are certain qualities that are somewhat unique to Asian companies. They love busywork and as a result do a lot of things manually that have long since been automated in the US. Furthermore, they're still averse to leaving work before their boss does, even if they've got nothing left to do. So of course being remote will have an outsized impact. \n\nThen there are other factors to consider; a big one being that wages in Asia have remained stagnant for decades. I don't see the average American tech worker being satisfied by the salaries their counterparts in Asia are pulling. Not that I think the American model is preferable at all, but my underlying point is that remote work is a net positive for everyone who can partake in it.", "created_at": 1675180517.0, "id": "j6ner5i", "parent": "t3_10plq1f", "score": 2}, {"body": "40hrs period.", "created_at": 1675181789.0, "id": "j6ni4e0", "parent": "t3_10plq1f", "score": 2}, {"body": "well this is horse shit", "created_at": 1675182185.0, "id": "j6nj69j", "parent": "t3_10plq1f", "score": 2}, {"body": "Disinformation  \n\n\nI will take remote work over in office work the rest of my life.
